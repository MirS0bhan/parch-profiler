### üì¶ **Parch-Profiler**

Parch-Profiler is a powerful Python-based utility designed specifically for Parch Linux. It simplifies the management of system packages and configurations by allowing you to generate, validate, and install packages‚Äîincluding AUR and Flatpak‚Äîusing a structured TOML configuration file.

## üöÄ **Features**

- **Package Installation:**
  - Install packages using Pacman, AUR (via `paru`), and Flatpak from a single TOML file.

- **Systemd Service Management:**
  - Enable and start systemd services as specified in the TOML configuration.

- **TOML Validation:**
  - Validate your TOML files to ensure they are correctly formatted.

- **Package List Generation:**
  - Automatically generate TOML files listing all installed Pacman, AUR, and Flatpak packages.

- **File-based TOML Generation:**
